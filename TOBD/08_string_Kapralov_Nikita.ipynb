This recipe is perfect for salmon fillet, even though it calls for salmon steaks.  I cut up the salmon into individual portions and followed the instructions exactly.  I'm on one of those food combining diets, so I left out the white wine but added just a dash of white wine vinegar instead (just a little bit, not enough to change the taste of the dish).  Super yummy, and leftovers for lunch today (lucky me)!\",\n",

Also, once the strawberries cook down, I use a potato masher to break them up a bit more and I like that consistency.  The black pepper kick in this jam is really fun, and it's great on toasted English muffins, as well as on peanut butter & jelly sandwiches (made with whole wheat bread.)

I took semi frozen chicken breasts, browned them, then added the vinegar and chicken stock to cook them the rest of the way through at a simmer. I did omit the sugar to avoid the sugary-ness some reviewers commented on and it was PERFECT. As for the couscous I didn't really change anything, except I used cold broth and let it soak because I had the time to wait for the frozen chicken breasts to cook. I also added a little more margarine because I wanted a nice garlic-buttery flavor (and it certainly didn't disappoint). Served with recipe #289161. Thanks so much Miraklegirl!\",\n",

The marinade smelled like carne asada and maybe that is what I was expecting.  I also cooked it on a grill pan and it smelled delightful while grilling but just didn't meet expectations when served.

I used half of a red onion, 1 very large tomato and the zest and juice of one lemon, didn't have any coriander leaves so left those out. I was surprised that this went over so well at the BBQ (my DP's are almost fearful of vegetarian/organic food), but they gobbled this right up without even noticing the tahini (which I'm sure they've never had before).

Remembering how much this rises, I only filled the plate half full, and used the rest of the batter to make up 6 corn muffins.

The glaze is TDF good, a fudgy smooth consistency, and even DH who doesn\\'t like coconut thought the shredded coconut on top was perfect. So, for taste we all would agree on a definite 5 stars. :) My concern is that the recipe could benefit from some modifications & clarifications. The first thing I would want to point out is that the recipe as printed doesn\\'t make just \"large\" cupcakes. It will make JUMBO cupcakes. I don\\'t have a jumbo pan so I would have cut the recipe down had I known before hand. Instead I ended up making 36 regular sized cupcakes & because they had to be cooled in the pan before removing to wire rack (& because of the cakes\\' texture, this was in fact necessary) it took 3 hours just to bake all 36 cakes (2 days from start to finish). As far as the recipe, I think there is much too much butter. So much that the muffin tins felt as if I\\'d greased them before putting the paper liners in, but I didn\\'t. I also think the amount of sugar called for is overkill. They didn\\'t taste overly sweet, but the tops of the cakes are nearly caramelized. The butter sank to the bottom & made the cake greasy while the sugar floated to the top & turned into a sticky candy coating. Removing the cakes from the pan &/or removing the paper liners without tearing the entire top of the cake was a very slow & tedious process. I did enough to get a satisfactory photo but will just let everyone remove their own now. :) Again, this recipe is worth the effort in flavor & we would give 5 stars for that. Thanks for sharing, my3bb! Made for ZWT5-Ali Baba\\'s Babes.  UPDATE:  It\\'s been 4 days since I made these & they\\'ve been sitting out on the counter the whole time (not covered or sealed).  I just finished eating one & cannot believe that it\\'s still SO GOOD!  They\\'re not greasy anymore & still aren\\'t dried out.  The cake is still moist & only just approaching the \"day old\" stage around the top edge that isn\\'t in paper or covered in frosting.  The frosting is like biting into a rich, creamy fudge & was such a nice surprise.  I\\'m tempted to say that making these a day or two ahead of an event would be just perfect as far as their aging to perfection & the convenience of being able to make a baked good ahead.  :)',\n",

The amount of gluten is definitely necessary for binding all the chickpeas together, but its texture is too overbearing.

Very staight-forward preparation, the biggest challenge is getting the filled wrappers into a uniform eye pleasing shape. I did sustitute ground turkey (didn't have a chilli pepper), opted for peas, and otherwise stuck to the recipe. The first test batch was less than impressive, the wonton wrappers were a dry/crisp and dull, so after asking-used a very light brush of oil and a pinch of salt made them soft and inviting(can also use cooking oil spray). I found the spice level/combination very agreeable but felt it was repetitious(maybe because of the turkey being less powerful than beef) and in need something. I noticed other people use rasins or sultanas so I chopped some for a second test batch--yummy! They added a needed contrast for my liking and the taste was complete. I wanted to give 5 stars but I've never had Samosas before so I can't say how traditional these taste.\\nAs far as quantity,I made 12-15 filled wonton wraps and filled a small burrito wrap for neighbor to munch on and still had about 3/4 of the mixture remaining (in the fridge for tommorow) so I'd say #60 individual peices easily.

I\\'ve never heard of an 8-oz can of tomato soup so now I wonder if the poster meant tomato SAUCE?  I think I might try it that way next time (i.e., tomato sauce instead of soup).  This substitution will cut the sweetness (the sweetness wasn\\'t BAD, but I think it would be more cajun-y without).  I\\'ll also use a 15-oz can of diced tomatoes and a 4-oz can of diced green chilies, because that\\'s what I usually have on hand.  Regarding cooking time, make sure to cook for the full 15 minutes at the end because my rice was undercooked when I put it in \"just until cheese melts\"; thankfully, I was able to toss it back in the oven for the remaining time and all was well.  Because we\\'re only a houseful of two, I like casseroles that I can split and freeze half for another meal.

Both batches finally eventually started growing after I added a teaspoon of sugar.  I was even measuring the temperature of my water, and keeping my oven at the recommended (measured) ambient temperature (always taking my stuff out of the oven when turning the element on).

Due to oven space constraints, I just baked it in two one-pound loaf pans, turned it out at the end and rubbed the tops with butter.  Baking soda breads rise quite high, so I only let it get to barely the tops of the pans and it was perfect.  It was very easy to make and it seemed like each rising only took about 45 minutes or so.  Next time, I will have everything measured in the mixer bowl before I start the yeast.  I was gathering all of the other ingredients and suddenly noticed I had a yeast volcano going!!

I also garnished with some fresh basil, and some ancho chile powder, both flavors that really enhance the corn.  Although the recipe calls for straining the mixture before serving, I opted not to, and instead used a hand blender to puree it even more finely in the pan.  I like the texture this way, and so did DH.  He actually thought it should be a bit thicker, which I may accomplish next time by adding a little flour between steps one and two.  My only issue, and it's a minor one, was the balance of flavor between the corn and the onion.  I thought the onion was a little strong, so next time I think I'll either use a little less, or use a sweet onion instead of the plain yellow onion that I used this time.

       " \"We SO enjoyed this for tonight's dinner: delicious!  I always approach kugel recipes as fair game: an opportunity to vary what I throw in and what I omit according to the whim of the moment.  It was a while since I'd made kugel so I approached making this dish with considerable enthusiasm.  I made a few changes because of personal taste preferences and a few additions because I love the additional ingredients.  I omitted the hot pepper sauce and used only 1/2 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce (we have almost zero tolerance of anything hot and spicy), I doubled the garlic and I added an onion and one leek: just love the combination of onions, garlic and leek.  I also added a cup of thinly sliced mushrooms.  I added basil and oregano (as in the ingredients list) but also added rosemary, sage and thyme. I used low-fat cottage cheese and low-fat sour cream as I find that low-fat versions of these makes no appreciable difference to the final dish.  Once all the ingredients had been combined, I added two eggs - as eggs have featured in most other kugel recipes I've made.  I baked the kugel in several smaller dishes as two were destined for the freezer.  I look forward to making this again - probably quite differently next time.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Oolala!  Made for Revised Bargain Basement.\",\n",
       " \"I just did this one, and here's what I did while cooking based on my stove. Start no higher than just over med. low (about 4 if your stove does low to high with numbers in between), when you're ready for the sugar, crank it to under med. high (about 6) for about a minute before adding the sugar. whisking thoroughly until it combines. Let it come to a boil, whisking occasionally. When it does, start the three-minute timer and go to town on the whisking. Chocolate is the worst scorcher you can have in a pan. Do not stop until the timer's done. Take off the heat while slowing down the whisking, then add the salt and vanilla. Take a spoon and coat the back of it. If it sticks, you got it right.\",\n",

I added 1 small chopped onion, 1 clove of minced garlic, 1 tsp. poultry seasoning, 1/2 tsp. marjoram and doubled the amount of broth.  Like other reviewers, I was afraid the amount of broth indicated would not be enough for the amount of time it would be cooking.  I also omitted the dumplings, as DH dislikes the texture.

       " 'I love how people say they made it &quot;exactly as written&quot; and then proceed to explain that they changed almost every single step. Lol',\n",
       " 'Surprising good and filling.  Very simple.  Used veggie stock this time.  Would try with chicken stock and maybe poultry seasoning next time.  Used 1/4 t. garlic powder.  Would probably increase that, too.  Did not use cheese-- still great though.',\n",
       " 'Very good!  i used olive oil instead of butter.  much better than store bought, and cheaper too!',\n",
       " 'This was so east and really good.  Next time I will add some chili peppers to bring out some flavor.  I made it with spaghetti and my family enjoyed it.  Made for This Little Piggy Went To The Market Event 09',\n",

       " \"Well apparently my previous review didn't 'take', so here I am again! Pretty much followed your recipe on down & really loved the coconut, but then I'm also a big fan of cherries, so that was a nice plus, too! Another time I might add a can of sweet cherries, but we were very happy with the cake as made! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed just for the halibut!]\",\n",

       " \"Delicious and SO quick and easy!  I needed a quick dessert for dinner with relatives the Sunday after Thanksgiving and chose this because it's very UN-Thanksgiving-ish (Love those pumpkin pies but, come on now!).  It was a hit....I'll be making this again - maybe for next year's Thanksgiving! Thanks Junebug :)\",\n",
       " 'This is intense and wonderful. To be honest it seemed like too much butter for me so i cut back on the butter a bit and i was perfect. I used this for a Dobos Torta and it was like I was at a good bakery back in Transylvania.',\n",

We had them along with a nice scoop of French Vanilla ice cream.  Everyone here really enjoyed a lot!  I loved the flavor of the roasted nuts along with the raspberry preserves.  Next time I may make a sauce with fresh raspberries or strawberries.  It would be great to change up the berries or do some combinations.  Mine came out bar-like, not cake like, which I liked.  I didn't stir them too much, just mixed to incorporate the ingredients, but didn't beat to death.  We will have these again, and from the thumbs up from my company it may be sooner than I think!  Thanks and good luck with the contest!\",\n",

My youngest had commented recently how he\\'d really like to try one of those \"Krispy Kreme\" donuts everyone on TV is always talking about (they are no Krispy Kremes here in Alaska).  We tried this recipe with wonderful results!!  Made the entire batch and then froze half of them in a big ziplock bag. I recommend freezing..they were great thawed by popping them in the microwave to gently warm.  \\nWe discovered it is best to wait until the donuts are almost cool to dip in the glaze. Otherwise the glaze isn\\'t quite thick enough. Next time we\\'ll try maple favoring etc, just for fun. \\nI found cooking them at 365 for the full 2 minutes a side was fine, but they got a little over brown, so I shortened it up a bit. It isn\\'t the recipe, but how big you cut each donut..mine must have been on the small side.  \\n Thank you Lorri, we\\'ll be making these way too often (g)',\n",

       "  'i strongly suggest due to the large amount of cheese filling to use a pan with higher sides or a lasagna pan however you definitely could use a 13 x 9inch pan but it will be very full i make this in my lasagna pan you will most likely have some sauce left over so just freeze for another time this sauce freezes very well the secret to great lasagna starts with a great sauce and lots of it so dont be shy to use lots of sauce this sauce must be made a day ahead which not only allows the flavors to blend and improve but also is a big time saver it may even made up to 5 days ahead the longer refrigeration time the better the sauce will be also to save some time an to blend the flavors i suggest to mix up the cheese filling a day ahead so all you have left to do is boil the pasta and layer the lasagna although the recipe states to use only 16 noodles but will depend on the size of pan you are using i always cook more just in case some of the noodles happen to crack while boiling the complete recipe may be layered in the pan covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours in advance since the tomato sauce is spread on top of the mozzarella cheese i strongly advise to use only sliced for the layering if you use shredded you will need to dollop the sauce on top then carefully spread prep time for this recipe does not include making the sauce you may adjust the noodles to the size of your pan and also the sauce amounts may be adjusted to taste the spinach may be doubled if desired also one pound fresh sliced mushrooms may be added to the tomato sauce'],\n",

       "  'this is my own recipe that i have made for over 25 years i have made these for weddings socials and large get togethers and everyone loves them i have two large cabbage listed as you will need extra cabbage leaves to line the bottom and top of the pan to prevent the rolls from over browning which may happen during the long cooking time cooked rice will also be fine for this and if you like lots of rice you may increase amount make certain that the heads of cabbage are frozen then completely thawed before starting this recipe this will allow for easy removal of the leaves allow the frozen cabbage heads thaw at room temperature overnight in bowls to save some time i most always remove the cabbage leaves a day ahead and refrigerate in a bowl and you may even prepare the ground beef mixture a day ahead so the following day just mix the sauce roll and cook for these cabbage rolls i do not precook the ground beef it will cook thoroughly in the oven i have listed the sauerkraut as optional if you are a sauerkrautlover then add it in i most always do it really adds extra flavor to the cabbage and you may use more than 12 cup if desired the amounts listed will fill a 13 x 9inch pan very full or even better so you do not over crowd the rolls a larger pan may be used or use two pans and freeze one for another meal just thaw overnight in the fridge then allow to sit at room temperature for about 2 hours then cook as stated if you like lots of sauce then you may double amounts but i would suggest to make it in a larger baking pan if you are doubling the sauce .'],\n",
